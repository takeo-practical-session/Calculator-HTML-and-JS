### Task: Build a Simple Calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  

#### Objective  
Create a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo) interactively in the browser. Write up the simple css that would show the business layout of an calculator. Consider this project to be a fun project. Dont stress on it if you are not able to do it. Just consult with SME.

### Instructions  

1. **HTML Structure**  
   - Set up a basic calculator layout using a combination of input fields, buttons, and a display area.  

2. **JavaScript Logic**  
   - Write a JavaScript program that handles button clicks, performs the requested operation, and displays the result.  

### Features  

- **Input Validation**: If the inputs are invalid (e.g., empty fields or non-numeric values), show an error message.  
- **Dynamic Results**: Display the result of the operation dynamically below the calculator.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the calculator looks good on different screen sizes.  

### Bonus Challenges  
1. **Keyboard Support**: Allow users to press keys (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) to trigger operations.  
2. **History Feature**: Maintain a history of calculations below the result area.  
3. **Dark Mode**: Add a toggle for dark mode styling.
